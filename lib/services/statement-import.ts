/**
 * BANK STATEMENT PDF IMPORT — PARSING LAYER.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE.
 *
 * Parsing a PDF is inherently unreliable. A PDF has no table structure — it is
 * glyphs at coordinates. Column alignment, wrapped descriptions, page headers
 * and footers all vary between banks and even between statement periods from
 * the same bank. A parser that works perfectly on one statement can silently
 * misread the next.
 *
 * That is why this module NEVER writes to the ledger. It only produces a
 * proposal. An administrator reviews every parsed row against the PDF in front
 * of them and confirms before a single franc moves. The human is the
 * verification step, and that is deliberate: with the Jenga API we can
 * re-query the bank to confirm a transaction, but a PDF has no second source —
 * the document *is* the bank's record, and someone has to attest that it is
 * genuine and correctly read.
 *
 * Everything downstream of confirmation reuses the existing pipeline: the same
 * duplicate constraints, the same member-matching rules, the same ledger, the
 * same audit trail.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

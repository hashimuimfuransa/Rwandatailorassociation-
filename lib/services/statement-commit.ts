/**
 * BANK STATEMENT IMPORT — COMMIT LAYER.
 *
 * Turns rows an administrator has reviewed and confirmed into Payment records,
 * then hands them to the ordinary reconciliation pipeline.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE API PATH, AND WHY:
 *
 * The Jenga path verifies a transaction by re-querying the bank. A PDF has no
 * second source to query — the document IS the bank's record. So verification
 * here is an ADMINISTRATOR'S ATTESTATION: by confirming the import they state
 * that this is their association's genuine statement and that the rows were
 * read correctly. That attestation is recorded on every payment it creates
 * (`ingestSource: MANUAL`, the attesting user, the file name and its hash),
 * so months later it is possible to answer "who said this payment happened,
 * and on the strength of what document?".
 *
 * WHAT IS IDENTICAL:
 *
 * Everything after that. Same duplicate constraints, same member-matching
 * rules and confidence threshold, same ledger, same audit trail, same
 * notifications. An imported payment cannot skip a check that an API payment
 * must pass.

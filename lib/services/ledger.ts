/**
 * THE SAVINGS LEDGER.
 *
 * Every franc that enters or leaves a member's savings passes through
 * `postSavingsTransaction`. There is no other write path to a balance, and
 * that is the point — `member.balance += amount` is exactly the pattern this
 * module exists to make impossible.
 *
 * The guarantees, and how each is obtained:
 *
 *  1. ATOMIC. The ledger row, the account balance, the running totals and the
 *     audit entry are written in ONE database transaction. A crash halfway
 *     leaves nothing behind rather than a balance that disagrees with history.
 *
 *  2. SERIALISED PER ACCOUNT. The balance is moved by a single UPDATE that
 *     computes the new value from the stored one (`balance = balance + delta`)
 *     while holding the row-exclusive lock that UPDATE itself takes. The
 *     application never reads a balance, decides, and writes it back — which
 *     is the read-modify-write window through which two concurrent deposits
 *     both see the same starting figure and the second erases the first. That
 *     lost update is the most common way savings systems quietly lose money,
 *     and it is proven absent by the concurrency tests.
 *
 *  3. GAPLESS AND ORDERED. Each row takes `lastSequence + 1`, protected by a
 *     unique index on (savingsAccountId, sequence). Two writers cannot claim
 *     the same slot, and a missing number is visible evidence of tampering.
 *
 *  4. RECONSTRUCTABLE. Every row stores balanceBefore and balanceAfter, so the
 *     cached balance can be re-derived and verified against history at any
 *     time. `verifyAccountIntegrity` does exactly that.
 *
 *  5. APPEND-ONLY. Nothing here updates or deletes a posted row. A mistake is
 *     corrected by posting a reversal that points back at the original, and
 *     both survive.

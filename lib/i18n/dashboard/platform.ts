/**
 * The super administrator's screens: every association on the platform, the
 * administrators who run them, integrations, background jobs and permissions.
 *
 * Translated for completeness rather than necessity — these are operator
 * screens, and an operator who cannot read English is unlikely to be running a
 * multi-tenant platform. But a half-translated product is one where nobody
 * knows which half, so the language switch works the same way everywhere.
 *
 * Machine identifiers stay as they are: job names, permission keys, integration
 * provider names and enum values are the strings the code and the logs use, and
 * translating them would make a screen impossible to match to a log line.

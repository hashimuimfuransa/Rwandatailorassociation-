 * Membership registration.
 *
 * The page keeps its original layout — back button, SectionHeading, the same
 * container and spacing — but the Google Form iframe has been replaced by a
 * native form that writes into the association's own database.
 *
 * That change is what makes the rest of the platform possible: an application
 * now creates a member record, a membership number, a savings account and,
 * critically, a unique payment reference. Without a reference issued at
 * registration, incoming payments have nothing reliable to match on.

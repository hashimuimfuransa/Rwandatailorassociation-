/**
 * POST /api/admin/statements/import
 *
 * Commits the rows an administrator reviewed and ticked.
 *
 * The client sends back the parsed rows it was shown, plus the fingerprints of
 * the rows selected. Re-parsing server-side instead would be marginally
 * tidier, but it would mean the admin confirms one parse and the system
 * commits a different one — they must be the same rows that were on screen.
 *
 * Every amount is re-validated here regardless, and the ledger applies its own
 * constraints, so a tampered payload cannot post a value the ledger would not
 * otherwise accept. What it CAN do is post a payment the admin did not see —
 * which is why this endpoint requires the manual-match permission and is
 * audited with the attesting user against every row.

/**
 * POST /api/admin/members
 *
 * Enrols a member directly, for an administrator transcribing a completed
 * paper application rather than waiting for someone to self-register.
 *
 * The association is resolved from the caller's own scope and is never taken
 * from the request body — accepting one would let an administrator of one
 * association enrol members into another.
 *
 * The temporary password is returned exactly once, in this response. It is
 * stored only as a hash, so if the administrator loses it the member must go
 * through password reset.

/**
 * POST /api/admin/payments/bulk-delete
 *
 * Clears several unattributable payments from the queue at once.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   • `paymentIds` — the rows the administrator ticked.
 *   • `scope: "ALL_QUEUED"` — every unmatched or failed payment in their
 *     association. The ids are resolved server-side rather than sent by the
 *     browser, so "all" cannot be widened by a crafted request.
 *
 * Payments that reached the ledger are refused individually and reported back;
 * the rest still go. Each deletion is audited separately at CRITICAL severity.
